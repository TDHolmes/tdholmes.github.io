## [Binary Clock][Binary Clock Link]

The Binary Clock project started when I wanted a simple clock that displayed the
time in binary coded decimal. After looking online and finding none that looked
good, I made my own.

More information, documentation, and a high level overview can be found
[here][Binary Clock Link].

## [Harma][Harma Link]

The Harma (meaning Mimic in Swedish) project is a solution to my shaky, over caffeinated hands.
It is a robot-assisted soldering tool, much like [robot-assisted surgery][Robot Assisted Surgery],
but much less expensive (hopefully).

More info [here][Harma Link].

## [Pensel][Pensel Link]

The Pensel (brush or pencil in Swedish) project is the sub-component of the Harma
project that gets the user's input. The user holds the Pensel like it was the soldering
iron and the robotic arm mimics their movement on a finer scale, as well as filtering
out jitter.

This is currently the main part I am working on for the overall Harma project.
More info can be found [here][Pensel Link].
