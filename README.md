## [Binary Clock][Binary Clock Link]

The Binary Clock project started when I wanted a simple clock that displayed the
time in binary coded decimal. After looking online and finding none that looked
good, I made my own.

More information, documentation, and a high level overview can be found
[here][Binary Clock Link].

## [Harma][Harma Link]

The Harma (meaning Mimic in Swedish) project is a solution to my shaky, over caffeinated hands.
It is a robot-assisted soldering tool, much like [robot-assisted surgery][Robot Assisted Surgery],
but much less expensive (hopefully).

More info [here][Harma Link].

## [Pensel][Pensel Link]

The Pensel (meaning brush or pencil in Swedish) project is the sub-component of the Harma
project that gets the user's input. The user holds the Pensel like it was the soldering
iron and the robotic arm mimics their movement on a finer scale, as well as filtering
out jitter.

This is currently the main part I am working on for the overall Harma project.
More info can be found [here][Pensel Link].

## Ice Dancer

The Ice Dancer was a project in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Shepard and
Dr. Thomas Rodengen to measure ice thickness formation during the winter on
Minnesota lakes.

The Ice Dancer works by freezing a PVC pipe into the ice with a stopper on the bottom
and a metal ring around the outside. The Ice Dancer then lowers a magnet down to the bottom
on a string, attaches to the metal ring, and pulls it up. The Ice Dancer measures the distance
via an encoder on the motor and determines if it is pulling the metal ring by measuring the
amount of current the motor is drawing.

Everything for this project worked, except for the SD card reader. I unfortunately
had to end the project there without resolving this as Senior Design was taking up
too much of my time.
